== DESCRIPTION

This module allows Ruby programs to interface with the SQLite3
database engine (http://www.sqlite.org).  You must have the
SQLite engine installed in order to build this module.

This module embeds its own SQLite3 library built from the SQLite
amalgamation, so it doesn't have any external dependencies

== SYNOPSIS

  require "sqlite3"
  
  # Open a database
  db = SQLite3::Database.new "test.db"
  
  # Create a table
  rows = db.execute <<-SQL
    create table numbers (
      name varchar(30),
      val int
    );
  SQL
  
  # Execute a few inserts
  {
    "one" => 1,
    "two" => 2,
  }.each do |pair|
    db.execute "insert into numbers values ( ?, ? )", pair
  end

  # Find a few rows
  db.execute( "select * from numbers" ) do |row|
    p row
  end

  # Create another table with multiple columns

  db.execute <<-SQL
    create table students (
      name varchar(50),
      email varchar(50),
      grade varchar(5),
      blog varchar(50)
    );
  SQL

  # Execute inserts with parameter markers
  db.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, email, grade, blog) 
              VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)", ["Jane", "me@janedoe.com", "A", "http://blog.janedoe.com"])
  
  db.execute( "select * from students" ) do |row|
    p row
  end
