= SQLite3/Ruby Interface with embedded SQLite3 library

* https://github.com/rangeroob/sqlite3-ruby-static

== DESCRIPTION
This module allows Ruby programs to interface with the SQLite3 database engine (www.sqlite.org). This module embeds its own SQLite3 library built from the SQLite amalgamation, so it doesn't have any external dependencies

== SYNOPSIS

  require "sqlite3-ruby-static"
  
  # Open a database
  db = SQLite3::Database.new "test.db"
  
  # Create a table
  rows = db.execute <<-SQL
    create table numbers (
      name varchar(30),
      val int
    );
  SQL
  
  # Execute a few inserts
  {
    "one" => 1,
    "two" => 2,
  }.each do |pair|
    db.execute "insert into numbers values ( ?, ? )", pair
  end

  # Find a few rows
  db.execute( "select * from numbers" ) do |row|
    p row
  end

  # Create another table with multiple columns

  db.execute <<-SQL
    create table students (
      name varchar(50),
      email varchar(50),
      grade varchar(5),
      blog varchar(50)
    );
  SQL

  # Execute inserts with parameter markers
  db.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, email, grade, blog) 
              VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)", ["Jane", "me@janedoe.com", "A", "http://blog.janedoe.com"])
  
  db.execute( "select * from students" ) do |row|
    p row
  end


== Compilation and Installation

To build the gem do the following:

  gem build sqlite3-ruby-static.gemspec
  gem install sqlite3-ruby-static-*.gem
  
Or to build the gem under the sqlite3 name:

  gem build sqlite3.gemspec
  gem install sqlite3-*.gem
  
== Use with Rails 

To use this library with Ruby on Rails put this in the Gemfile:

  gem 'sqlite3', git: 'https://github.com/rangeroob/sqlite3-ruby-static', tag: 'v1.4.2.20200412165500.3.22'
  # You can use branch (ie: master), ref, tag (ie: like the example above).
  
This should make Ruby on Rails think it is using the sqlite3 gem (which Ruby on Rails has a hard dependency on).
